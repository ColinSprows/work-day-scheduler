## Description

I wanted to create this to help with my daily organization. It helps a lot with time management, and during the process I learned a lot about Jquery.

## Installation

## Usage

Once you have navigated to the URL, you can use the text area next to the corresponding times to plan your day! Click the little blue save button to the side to save what you have written for later!
